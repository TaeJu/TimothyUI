 Initiative Reason:
 In my community, I recognized the challenges individuals face in finding compatible ride-sharing partners
 on short notice so I took the initiative and developed this application to address this issue. Before, carpool
 assignments were taken care of by one person who would send out google forms 2-3 days in advance and
 match people manually which was a very heavy burden. At first, it was built in monolithic application design
 but later I modernized into distributed platforms to practice Microservice architecture to achieve real time
 matching utilizing Kafka
